The polices and guidance presented here are being developed specific to AFSC-MML team members and with a specific focus on **scientific code**, **scientific products** and other un-official communication **in support of Fundamental Research Communications**. 

This repository is a fork from @CommerceGov and is meant to provide some consistency and guidance to AFSC-MML team members regarding 

1. repositories that are under the AFSC-MML organization and 
2. repositories under individual accounts related to NOAA research.
