# Policies-Guidance

The polices and guidance presented here are being developed specific to @NMML team members and with a specific focus on *scientific code*, *scientific products* and other un-official communication *in support of Fundamental Research Communications*. 

This repository is a fork from @CommerceGov and is meant to provide some consistency and guidance to @NMML team members regarding 

1. repositories that are under the @NMML organization and 
2. repositories under individual accounts related to NOAA research.
